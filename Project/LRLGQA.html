<h1>No-Â­reference Geometry Quality Assessment for Point Clouds Via List-wise Rank Learning</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Geometry quality assessment (GQA) of point clouds is crucial for evaluating the performance of emerging point cloud-based solutions (e.g., watermarking, compression, and reconstruction) and ensuring a certain level of experience quality. 
Unfortunately, existing objective GQA approaches are traditional full-reference metrics, whereas state-of-the-art learning-based point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods target both color and geometry distortions, neither of which are qualified for the no-reference GQA task.
In addition, the lack of large-scale GQA datasets with subjective scores, which are always imprecise, biased, and inconsistent, also hinders the development of learning-based GQA metrics. 
Driven by these limitations, this paper proposes a no-reference geometry-only quality assessment approach based on list-wise ranking learning, termed LRL-GQA, which comprises of a geometry quality assessment network (GQANet) and a list-wise rank learning network (LRLNet).
The proposed LRL-GQA formulates the no-reference GQA as a list-wise rank problem, with the objective of directly optimizing the entire quality ordering.
To be specific, a large dataset containing a variety of geometry-only distortions is constructed first, named LRL dataset, in which each sample is label-free but coupled with quality ranking information.
Then, the GQANet is designed to capture intrinsic multi-scale patch-wise geometric features and predict a quality index for each point cloud.
After that, the LRLNet leverages the LRL dataset and a likelihood loss to train the GQANet, and ranks the input list of degraded point clouds according to their distortion levels.
In addition, the pre-trained GQANet can be fine-tuned further to obtain absolute quality scores.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed no-reference LRL-GQA method compared with existing full-reference GQA metrics.
